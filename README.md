# ChromaStarPy
python stellar atmosphere and spectrum modeling code

A python3 code to compute the vertial structure of a static, plane-parallel, one-dimensional stellar atmosphere in local thermodynamic 
equilibrium (LTE), and to compute the emergent spectrum incorporating opacity computed with a comprehensive atomic line list from 
the NIST Atomic Spectra Database (https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-spectra-database) (Kramida, A., Ralchenko, Y., and Reader, J.,
and the NIST team, NIST Atomic Spectra Database ver 5.3, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Md.).

Provides post-processed data products that are ready to visualize in a python IDE such as spyder.  

Useful for senior undergrads in astronomy and physics to experiment with and develop a stellar astrophysical modeling code in a graphical 
IDE, and to compare observational data to ad hoc model output.

This is a port of the Java ChromaStarServer code (see GrayStar github repository) and will be kept synced with it.
